Electricity Supply Act:

- Electricity Supply Act of 1999 covers all non-utility-owned turbines built before 2003 – covering approximately 85 percent of all turbines at that time. The act obligates the transmission system operator to purchase all wind power production for a period of 10 years from the date the turbine was connected to the grid (Energinet 2007). Importantly, the producers do not need to pay for the balancing costs associated with wind power production – instead the grid operator, Energinet, takes on balancing responsibility.
